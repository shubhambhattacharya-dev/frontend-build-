Here's a well-structured README template for your Bootstrap project, incorporating your learning journey and deployment details. I'll format it clearly with sections and explanations:

# Portfolio Project using Bootstrap 🚀

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Demo-Render-%2300B4FF?style=for-the-badge)](https://portfolio-shubham-bhattacharya.onrender.com)

## Overview 👨💻
My first responsive portfolio built with Bootstrap framework, focusing on:
- Bootstrap's 12-column grid system
- CDN integration for rapid development
- Responsive design principles
- External CSS customization

## Key Features ✨
- **Bootstrap Components**: Navbars, cards, and modals
- **Grid Magic**: 
  ```html
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">Left Section</div>
    <div class="col-md-6">Right Section</div>
  </div>
  ```
- **Custom CSS**: Separate stylesheet for personal tweaks
- **Responsive Images**: `img-fluid` class implementation

## Tech Stack 💻

## Deployment Journey 🚀
Initially attempted GitHub Pages but faced image path issues:
```diff
- Incorrect path: src="Desktop/images/photo.jpg"
+ Correct path: src="assets/images/photo.jpg"
```
Successfully deployed using **Render** with:
1. Connected GitHub repository
2. Automatic deployment on push
3. Free web service tier

## Lessons Learned 📚
- **Bootstrap Grid**: Mastered column management for responsive layouts
- **CDN Advantage**: No local files needed for Bootstrap core
- **Path Matters**: Relative vs absolute paths difference
- **CSS Strategy**:
  ```css
  /* Custom CSS file */
  .my-class {
    margin: 1rem; /* Combines with Bootstrap classes */
  }
  ```

## Setup Instructions ⚙️
1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in browser
3. For local development:
   - Live Server extension recommended
   - Keep assets in relative folders:
     ```
     /assets
       /images
       /css
         styles.css
     ```
